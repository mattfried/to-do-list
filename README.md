To Do List web app<br>
https://mattfried.github.io/to-do-list/


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used ReactJS to create an interactive UI for this app, which gives the user the ability to add and delete tasks at will. A number counter is provided in the header to display the current total number of tasks in the list at any given time.

The bulk of this ReactJS app uses function and class components to store data, handle state changes, and then pass this data up and down the component chain via props.
