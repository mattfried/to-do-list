To Do List web app<br>
https://mattfried.github.io/to-do-list/

### About:
To Do List web app built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Approach:
I used ReactJS to create an interactive UI for this app, which gives the user the ability to add and delete tasks at will. A number counter is provided in the header to display the current total number of tasks in the list at any given time.

The bulk of this ReactJS app uses function and class components to store data, handle state changes, and then pass this data up and down the component chain via props.

### Branches:
In this repo, the master branch contains the development projects files, and in gh-pages is the production build hosted by GitHub pages. A resource that I used for deploying my Create React App to GitHub pages: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages
